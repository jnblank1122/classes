    <p class="information">Formed in the fall of 1999 by guitarist Jake Lisowski, vocalist Edward B. Gieda III, drummer Chris Abbott, bassist Jason Hudak, and organist Phillip Reynolds Price, the band quickly amassed material and recorded their cassette demo "1.)Sex 2.)Bird 3.)Cake." The following summer marked the first of many expansive tours that An Albatross has become renowned for.
      In 2001, Philadelphian upstart label When Humans Attack! Records produced and released the Eat Lightning, Shit Thunder 12" EP. Following the release of the 12", the CD version was pressed with permission by Bloodlink Records. The record was completed in two sessions during the winter months of 2000-2001 at Dungeon Studios in Upper Darby, PA. Despite the record only consisting of 11 minutes of music, nearly 20 hours were spent recording and mixing the record. Creatively Eat Lightning, Shit Thunder was a departure from the grindcore-based, deep/growled-vocal laiden 1999 demo and resembled a hybrid of early 1990s grindcore, speed metal, and hints of progressive rock. The 12" EP debut spawned an exhaustive tour that bled into the writing and recording process of their second album, We Are The Lazer Viking CD-EP.</p>
